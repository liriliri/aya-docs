Last Updated: 2025-10-28

Welcome to AYA (the “App”). We value your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information and the rights you can exercise. If you do not agree with this Policy, please stop using the App.

## 1. Scope
This Policy applies to the processing of information when you use the AYA app and its related services.

## 2. Information We Collect
- Not collected: We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information. We do not require sign-up/sign-in and do not collect device identifiers, location, contacts, camera/photos/microphone data, notification tokens, advertising identifiers, or usage analytics data.
- Local data: The App may store necessary runtime configurations on your device (e.g., preferences, cache). Such data remains only on your device and is removed when you uninstall the App.
- Information you provide: When you contact the developer via email, we process the information you voluntarily provide (such as your email address, message content, and attachments) solely for communication and issue handling.

## 3. How We Use Information
- Only when you proactively contact us, to reply, troubleshoot, and improve the product.
- We do not conduct profiling, marketing, or any advertising purposes.

## 4. Permissions and “Tracking”
- System permissions: The App does not request system permissions such as camera, photos, microphone, contacts, Bluetooth, notifications, or location.
- Advertising tracking: We do not engage in cross-app or cross-website “tracking,” do not use advertising identifiers, and do not require Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) authorization.

## 5. Sharing and Third Parties
- We do not sell your personal information.
- We do not share information with unrelated third parties and have not integrated third-party SDKs (including analytics, crash reporting, advertising, or push).
- Purchases and payments: No in-app purchases (IAP) or any online payments.

## 6. Data Storage and Retention
- Local data: Stored only on your device; you can delete it by uninstalling the App.
- Email correspondence data: Retained for the minimum period necessary to achieve the purpose of communication; you may request deletion via the contact email, and we will process it within a reasonable period.

## 7. Your Rights
- Access, correction, and deletion: You can request access to, correction of, or deletion of your email correspondence data via the contact email.
- Withdraw consent: If you no longer wish to be contacted, you can stop corresponding with us and request deletion.
- Account-related rights: The App has no account system; not applicable.

## 8. Children’s Privacy
The App is not designed for minors and does not actively collect any personal information. If you are a guardian and believe we obtained a minor’s information through communication, please contact us to request deletion.

## 9. Cross-Border Transfer
The App does not maintain servers or remote databases and does not perform cross-border data transfers. If you contact us via email, your emails may be transmitted and stored across different countries/regions, subject to your email service provider’s policies.

## 10. Updates to This Policy
If there are material changes to this Policy, we will provide notice in the App or on the project homepage. The updated Policy takes effect upon publication; your continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy.
